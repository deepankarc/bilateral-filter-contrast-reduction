# Bilateral Filter for Contrast Reduction

### HDR Imaging

This project is an implementation of a fast bilateral filter for contrast reduction (which can be used to display HDR images). The technique implemented is discussed in [1]. For a complete project desription refer [2].  Broadly the steps involved are:
1. Implementation of a bilateral filter
2. Downsampling in spatial and intensity domains
3. Tone mapping using the bilateral filter by using detail and base components of the image 

### Usage

To compute the response of the bilateral filter run using,
`python run_bf.py --imagepath PATH_TO_IMAGE`

To perform contrast reduction on an image run,
`python run_bf_tonemap.py --imagepath PATH_TO_IMAGE`
